11.1.1
------

 * Calculation of recovery priorities has been updated.
   This could lead to unintuitive recovery prioritization
   during cluster upgrade. In case of such recovery, OSDs
   in old version would operate on different priority ranges
   than new ones. Once upgraded, cluster will operate on
   consistent values.

 * When assigning a network to the public network and not to
   the cluster network the network specification of the public
   network will be used for the cluster network as well.
   In the older version this would lead to cluster services
   being bound to 0.0.0.0:<port>, thus actually making the
   cluster service even more publicly available than the
   public services. When only specifying a cluster network it
   will still result in the public services binding to 0.0.0.0.
